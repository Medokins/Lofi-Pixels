# Lofi-Pixels

Algorithm to generate random lofi-like pixel arts.

It's hard to find a good source for training so I'll try to do with [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/artvandaley/curated-pixel-art-512x512) dataset, from which I'll select samples that meet my interests.
I'll try to write an algorithm to transform any image into pixel art to increase size of training dataset.<br>
I'm getting stuck with images being to mixed up to idenitfy, need to do more research on that topic.
