# Lofi-Pixels

Algorithm to generate random lofi-like pixel arts.

It's hard to find a good source for training so I'll try to do with [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/artvandaley/curated-pixel-art-512x512) dataset, from which I'll select samples that meet my interests.

I'm currently working on finding more images to train my model on and reading more in depth of how to make model trurly learn on given images instead of just mixing them.
